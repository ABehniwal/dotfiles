- `ci`: work related to CI
- `chore`: updating deps, etc.
- `doc`: documentation changes
- `drop`: deleting stuff or removing a feature
- `edit`: minor changes that aren't big enough to be considered a feature
- `polish`: copy editing or cleanup that doesn't affect functionality
- `refactor`: major rewriting or restructuring that doesn't fix bugs or affect functionality
- `style`: code style changes
