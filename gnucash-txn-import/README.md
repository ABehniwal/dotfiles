# Balance checkbook automation

## Instructions for getting data input

### Tech CU (for importing)

Go to Accounts, then use "Print" and save resulting HTML (HTML only, not webpage
complete). Save only a single file `data/TechCU.html` since it combines both
savings and checking.

### Citi (for importing)

Click the stupid Export icon,
choose "year to date", then export as CSV to `data/citi.csv`.

## BoA (if needed for auditing)

Under the "Download" button, grab the most recent transactions and export
as printable text format

### PayPal (only if needed for auditing)

Use the URL https://business.paypal.com/merchantdata/consumerHome
and download a CSV.
