# Balance checkbook automation

## Instructions for getting data input

### Tech CU

Go to Accounts, then use "Print" and save resulting HTML (HTML only, not webpage
complete). Save only a single file `data/TechCU.html` since it combines both
savings and checking.

### Citi

Choose "year to date", then export as CSV to `data/Citi.csv`.
